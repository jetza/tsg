These topics aroused great interest, contributed to the writing of quality papers and resulted in useful discussions at the symposium itself.",
    "fraudIssue": "However, we noticed that more and more disputes and proceedings are being conducted due to attempted insurance fraud. There were accused people from the traffic police, traffic-technical experts, assessors, liquidators, heads of insurance departments, etc. Therefore, we turned to organizing professional symposiums with the theme: 'Traffic Accident Expertise and Insurance Fraud'.",
    "development": "At the Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering in Belgrade and at TSG, models have been developed for detecting fraud and preparing traffic-technical expertise reports. Special attention is paid to insurance companies, lawyers, judges and prosecutors, and everyone interested in the field of insurance fraud.",

    "goal2": "The state loses huge funds due to treatment of the injured, costs of court proceedings and huge accompanying unnecessary costs that arise as a consequence of traffic accidents. Considering that the Republic of Serbia loses at least 3% of GDP due to damages caused by traffic accidents, and that about 2% of GDP is the share of the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Defense in the state budget, it is clear that the costs for the functioning of 1.5 ministries, including complete costs, citizens of Serbia unnecessarily destroy in traffic accidents.",
    "goal3": "The first two of the most important things that every person has are the life and freedom of each individual. Due to traffic accidents, both the lives and freedom of traffic accident participants are endangered, but in such a way that in peacetime the largest number of fatalities occurs as a consequence of traffic accidents in road traffic. Expertise of traffic accidents affects a fairer life for citizens because the real culprits are punished, and the damaged are compensated, unnecessary state costs are reduced and court proceedings are shortened.",
    "goal4": "It is especially important that quality and uniform expertise enables citizens of Serbia to be equal before the law and to avoid punishing the innocent.",
    "goal5": "With these Symposiums, we continue the path towards a uniform approach and solution to criminal and civil liability, towards a more realistic and fairer legal system and insistence that in this matter the influence of professionalism be strengthened to the level achieved in the developed world."

    "specifics": "You can learn the specifics of using the program, observed during the analysis of various traffic accident cases, in a very short time.",
    "about": "PC Crash is a software package whose use makes it possible to more precisely analyze elements on the basis of which it is possible to determine the causes and circumstances under which a traffic accident occurred. The program represents a tool that 'quickly' performs very complex calculations that cannot be carried out using 'conventional' methods.",
    "requirements": "For proper use of PC Crash software, professional knowledge in the field of traffic (especially traffic accident analysis) as well as knowledge of computer work is necessary. PC Crash is only an aid in traffic accident analysis, and the quality of input data on the basis of which the program performs calculations depends on the quality of the expert's work and the quality of material evidence from the File.",
    "precision": "With PC Crash software, it is possible to precisely check parameters determined by 'conventional' methods, as well as more precisely determine those parameters that could not be precisely determined by classical methods.",
    "example": "For example, it is often the case, in a head-on collision of a vehicle and a pedestrian, that traces fallen from the vehicle and/or pedestrian are recorded in the investigation documentation, as well as the stopping position of the pedestrian, so that 'conventional methods', using formulas, calculate the speed of the vehicle at the moment of collision based on the distance the pedestrian was thrown. The speed calculated in this way can have a deviation of ±10%, taking into account only the throwing distance of the pedestrian determined experimentally for a pedestrian of average height and weight, while PC Crash analyzes other details important for precise accident analysis, such as the height and weight of the pedestrian, the mutual position of the vehicle and the pedestrian (which can be determined based on the pedestrian's injuries), the characteristics of the vehicle involved in the accident (vehicle weight, number and weight of people in the vehicle, geometric characteristics of the vehicle, etc.).",
    "advanced": "PC Crash can help determine the place of collision when traces of the traffic accident are not (or are not quality) recorded. For example, in cases where traces of the traffic accident are not recorded, but vehicle damage is recorded, vehicle stopping positions, directions of vehicle movement are known and injuries to persons in the vehicles are described. Based on the damage, it is possible to precisely determine the mutual position of the vehicles at the moment of collision, and taking into account the injuries to persons in the vehicle, it is possible to estimate the speeds at which the vehicles were driven at the moment of collision. Based on this evidence, using PC Crash software, the collision site is 'searched for', which is possible to determine. This method of determining the collision site requires large time losses."
