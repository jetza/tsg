These topics aroused great interest, contributed to the writing of quality papers and resulted in useful discussions at the symposium itself.",
    "fraudIssue": "However, we noticed that more and more disputes and proceedings are being conducted due to attempted insurance fraud. There were accused people from the traffic police, traffic-technical experts, assessors, liquidators, heads of insurance departments, etc. Therefore, we turned to organizing professional symposiums with the theme: 'Traffic Accident Expertise and Insurance Fraud'.",
    "development": "At the Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering in Belgrade and at TSG, models have been developed for detecting fraud and preparing traffic-technical expertise reports. Special attention is paid to insurance companies, lawyers, judges and prosecutors, and everyone interested in the field of insurance fraud.",

Considering that the Republic of Serbia loses at least 3% of GDP due to damages caused by traffic accidents, and that about 2% of GDP is the share of the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Defense in the state budget, it is clear that the costs for the functioning of 1.5 ministries, including complete costs, citizens of Serbia unnecessarily destroy in traffic accidents.",
    "goal3": "The first two of the most important things that every person has are the life and freedom of each individual. Due to traffic accidents, both the lives and freedom of traffic accident participants are endangered, but in such a way that in peacetime the largest number of fatalities occurs as a consequence of traffic accidents in road traffic. Expertise of traffic accidents affects a fairer life for citizens because the real culprits are punished, and the damaged are compensated, unnecessary state costs are reduced and court proceedings are shortened.",
    "goal4": "It is especially important that quality and uniform expertise enables citizens of Serbia to be equal before the law and to avoid punishing the innocent.",

The program represents a tool that 'quickly' performs very complex calculations that cannot be carried out using 'conventional' methods.",
    "requirements": "For proper use of PC Crash software, professional knowledge in the field of traffic (especially traffic accident analysis) as well as knowledge of computer work is necessary. PC Crash is only an aid in traffic accident analysis, and the quality of input data on the basis of which the program performs calculations depends on the quality of the expert's work and the quality of material evidence from the File.",
    "precision": "With PC Crash software, it is possible to precisely check parameters determined by 'conventional' methods, as well as more precisely determine those parameters that could not be precisely determined by classical methods.",
    "example": "For example, it is often the case, in a head-on collision of a vehicle and a pedestrian, that traces fallen from the vehicle and/or pedestrian are recorded in the investigation documentation, as well as the stopping position of the pedestrian, so that 'conventional methods', using formulas, calculate the speed of the vehicle at the moment of collision based on the distance the pedestrian was thrown. The speed calculated in this way can have a deviation of ±10%, taking into account only the throwing distance of the pedestrian determined experimentally for a pedestrian of average height and weight, while PC Crash analyzes other details important for precise accident analysis, such as the height and weight of the pedestrian, the mutual position of the vehicle and the pedestrian (which can be determined based on the pedestrian's injuries), the characteristics of the vehicle involved in the accident (vehicle weight, number and weight of people in the vehicle, geometric characteristics of the vehicle, etc.).",
    "advanced": "PC Crash can help determine the place of collision when traces of the traffic accident are not (or are not quality) recorded. For example, in cases where traces of the traffic accident are not recorded, but vehicle damage is recorded, vehicle stopping positions, directions of vehicle movement are known and injuries to persons in the vehicles are described. Based on the damage, it is possible to precisely determine the mutual position of the vehicles at the moment of collision, and taking into account the injuries to persons in the vehicle, it is possible to estimate the speeds at which the vehicles were driven at the moment of collision. Based on this evidence, using PC Crash software, the collision site is 'searched for', which is possible to determine. This method of determining the collision site requires large time losses."

Our goal is to contribute to improving the level of public mass passenger transport safety by applying a series of systemic measures. Participation in the Safe Passenger Transport project is on a voluntary basis. In cooperation with the largest carriers in the country and other professional organizations, since December 2004, work has been carried out at the Department of Traffic Safety at the Faculty of Transport Engineering in Belgrade on establishing and improving activities and measures that carriers would use to reduce the risk of involvement in traffic accidents and the severity of consequences of traffic accidents that occur.",

      "subtitle": "Find out instructions for drivers who are going on a trip during summer months",
      "intro": "Many choose their car as a means of transport for some longer trips, for example abroad or to the sea. Due to frequent traffic jams and high temperatures, it is important that your car is in good condition so you can travel safely. Preparing a car for winter driving is somewhat more complicated than summer preparation because it involves winter tires, tire chains and similar equipment. However, there are also some rules for summer driving.",
      "section1Title": "Check the oil level in the engine and air conditioning",
      "section1Content": "Did you know that as many as one fifth of drivers drive with too little or too much oil in the engine? Checking the oil is not complicated, so it is advised to do it the right way. Checking the air conditioning is also necessary and is done before the start of the season. The check is performed by checking whether it cools sufficiently and whether it works at all speeds. Poor cooling means there is not enough coolant in the system. Gas in the air conditioner should be refilled every 2-3 years (or 4 years from the date of manufacture of the car). Often the cause of fluid deficiency is its leakage due to damage to the pipes. These problems are solved in a specialized air conditioning service. Another thing that is important for the good functioning of the air conditioner is the replacement of the filter. The filter collects bacteria and prevents them from entering the vehicle cabin. Car manufacturers usually recommend replacing the filter every 10-15 thousand kilometers driven.",
      "section2Title": "Do not overdo it with vehicle cooling",
      "section2Content": "Improperly adjusted temperature can be very dangerous. It is recommended that the difference between the temperature in the car and the outside temperature should not be greater than 5-6°C. It is advised that, if we overdo it and make temperature differences greater than 10°C, we turn off the air conditioning 15 minutes before leaving the vehicle so that the temperature difference can be reduced somewhat. Another tip regarding temperature in vehicles during the summer months is to park the car in the shade and use some sun protection for the windows.",
      "section3Title": "Road safety during the tourist season",
      "section3Content": "The basic thing is not to set off if you are not rested. Ideally, a half-hour break should be taken every two hours of driving. Of course, wherever you travel, it is important to comply with traffic regulations and signs. Never apply risky overtaking.",

        "description": "From January to July this year, 290 people died on the roads in Serbia. There are numerous appeals for drivers to be more careful on the roads. One of the last ones referred to wearing seat belts. During a seven-day check, as many as 7,000 people were fined. The fine for not wearing a seat belt is 5,000 dinars, and recently this obligation also applies to the back seats in the car. Despite the fines and statistics according to which most of the dead are those who were not wearing seat belts, many still do not respect the regulations. Most drivers wear seat belts out of fear of fines, and there are those who do it for safety. Professor Milan Vujanić says that the number of deaths in traffic accidents can be halved by using seat belts. He believes that the advantage of wearing seat belts should be emphasized more often and rejects the demands of professional drivers to be exempted.",
